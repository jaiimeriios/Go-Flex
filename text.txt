I’m a Web Designer with a focus on UX Design and Fontend Development. I design, craft products and visual experiences based on a deep understanding of customer needs.

Main area of my expertise is front end development and everything related with this side of web.




Creating Digital Experiences that Help Grow Businesses



Having gained experience working closely with teams to turn ideas into products, I’ve established a focus on a simple and refined process.




Minimal principles are the basis to my work, with a well thought out theory behind them. The focus of my work varies between mediums ranging from; user experience and interfaces, web design and development, branding, typography and print.

My belief and passion for feedback and discussions on design helps maintain multiple perspectives – seeing it as the key to working agile and efficiently – resulting in refined outcomes.




HTML,CSS, JS (ES5,ES6), building small & medium Web Apps, Angular , Vue.js, building custom plugins, features, animations and just coding layouts.

Often I work as a full-stack develeoper  – mainly in Lamp environment, PHP and open source CMS’s like (WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Typo 3 etc..) . I have also some experience with Node.js,  Mongo DB (Keystone.JS).


Producing high quality responsive websites and exceptional user experience



built this site from scratch. By scratch, I mean absolutely from scratch without any UI library/framework (except React though) and had so much fun along the way.
