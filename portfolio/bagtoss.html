						My primary role for the bagtoss redesign was to improve the brand online e-commerce experience for enthusiasts everywhere. We created an intuitive and easy to use experience that enabled users to quickly find what they are looking for. There was also an emphasis on accessing brand content throughout the site. This helped increase engagement and answer questions about the products.

		<p class="project-desc">
			As the Front-end Developer, I was responsible of redesigning the user experience for the  website, redefining the user interface and studying new interactions between the user and the Interface.
		</p>
		<p class="project-desc">
			For the core pages of the site, the goal was to create layouts that would be flexible enough to accomodate a robust content strategy.
		</p>
		<p class="project-desc">
			For this , is using <a href="https://www.opencart.com/" target="_blank">OpenCart</a> for the eCommerce platform.
		</p>

		<h3 class="project-desc">Reasons</h3>

		<p class="project-desc">
			<span class="bld">It's easy for development</span> - OpenCart is a system based on the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. It’s easy to develop extensions or customize OpenCart.
			<br>
			<span class="bld">It's easy to use</span> - Similar to other platforms, OpenCart has a very friendly administrative dashboard. All of the menus are very straightforward and user-friendly: Catalog, Sales, Extensions, System.
			<br>
			<span class="bld">It's easy to make changes on the store</span> - When you cannot get everything on the administrative dashboard, OpenCart makes is easy to modify files and customize it to your needs.
			<br>
			<span class="bld">Lots of well documentation</span> - A lot of information exists on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> and OpenCart site as well.
		</p>

		<h3 class="project-desc">Creating effective product pages</h3>
		
		<p class="project-desc">
			It’s fairly easy to add products and product pages to your store in most ecommerce platforms. However, if you really want your products to sell, you need approach your product pages the right way.
		</p>
		<p class="project-desc">
			<span class="bld">Title &amp; description</span> - The title and description field contain text that tells your potential customers what your product is, how it’s made, what it does and other important information. In addition to telling your customers about your product, your title and description are what Google will look at for determining which organic searches your product can show up for. It’s important to note that these organic search result placements are different than paid search text ads or Google Shopping ads.
		</p>
		<p class="project-desc">
			<span class="bld">Images</span> - In online shopping, image quality matters, a lot. Since people can’t actually examine your product in person, they are forced to rely on your images to make a decision. So, if you don’t have great images, you probably won’t have great sales, either. Ideally, it is best to have high-quality, clear images taken from a variety of angles. In addition, if your product has special features that you want to highlight it is also a good idea to include specific photographs of those features on your page.
		</p>
		<p class="project-desc">
			<span class="bld">Loading speed optimization</span> - Unfortunately, images are something of a double-edged sword. While high-quality images are great at convincing people to buy, they can also slow down your website. Most people will only tolerate a page load time of about 2 seconds, so if those beautiful photos don’t load quickly, they could end up killing off potential sales instead of aiding them!

		<h3 class="project-desc">The shopping cart experience</h3>

		<p class="project-desc">
			The better your shopping cart experience is, the more sales you will get. With cart abandonment rates floating around 80%, anything you can do to make your shopping cart experience easier and more intuitive is a step in the right direction.
		</p>
		<p class="project-desc">
			Using a simple Cart plug-in to keep your customers’ shopping cart items, well, in their shopping cart is an easy way to improve your cart experience.
